# debian-equivs

Useful (for me, anyways) dummy package configurations.

Configurations are initially generated using [`equivs-control(1)`](https://manpages.debian.org/stable/equivs/equivs-control.1.en.html) and are intended to be built using [`equivs-build(1)`](https://manpages.debian.org/stable/equivs/equivs-build.1.en.html).

[This thread on the Ubuntu forums](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=726317) has a pretty solid overview of using `equivs-config` and `equivs-build`.
